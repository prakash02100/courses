Introduction
The courses website provides a platform for users to access and learn from a variety of online courses. The website features a timeline-based interface that displays the course materials in chronological order, as well as a video player that allows users to watch the course videos and interact with other materials such as notes and bookmarks.

Installation
To install and run the website locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/prakash02100/courses.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd courses
Open the courses.html file in your web browser.
Usage
The website displays the courses timeline by default. You can click on a course to expand it and view its contents. The video player is available for courses that have video content. You can use the controls to play, pause, rewind, and adjust the volume of the video.

You can also access the notes and bookmarks for a course by clicking on the icons in the course header. The notes and bookmarks are stored locally in your browser's storage and are accessible even after you close and reopen the website.
